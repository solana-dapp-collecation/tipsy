Solana tipping on BitClout

#Tipsy improves upon the existing tipping mechanisms of BitClout

It encourages busking on web3 and incentivizes both tippers and tippees to crowdfund.

Ideas - quadratic funding, microtipping, escrows, cross-chain transactions

- The current "tipping" mechanism involves sending creator coins or diamonds. This is a zero-sum game.
- Creative projects require a consistent stream of funding. Patreon has proved this.
- Small value tips powered by Quadratic Funding encourages everyone to participate to support their favourite creator on BitClout.
- A simple button connected to the Sollet wallet makes it easy to integrate it with the BitClout API.
- BitClout's FOSS-nature and the ability to run one's own node lets us customize Tipsy as a creator-first crowdfunding platform.
