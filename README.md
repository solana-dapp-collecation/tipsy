# Tipsy - Solana tipping on BitClout

![Tipsy](SolClout.png)

Status: in development

Tipsy improves upon the existing tipping mechanisms of BitClout

It encourages busking on web3 and incentivizes both tippers and tippees to crowdfund.

Ideas - quadratic funding, microtipping, escrows, cross-chain transactions

- The current "tipping" mechanism involves sending creator coins or diamonds. This is a zero-sum game.
- We like positive-sum games. Small value tips powered by Quadratic Funding encourages everyone to participate.
- It's important to support one's favourite creator on BitClout with small tips based on their proof of work (posts).
- This idea of tipping has proven successful in live synchronous events Twitch, Youtube, etc.
- Asynchronous ad-hoc events are not designed for tipping. Tipsy fixes this.
- Creative projects require a consistent stream of funding. Patreon has proved this.

- A simple button connected to the Sollet wallet makes it easy to integrate it with the BitClout API.
- BitClout's FOSS-nature and the ability to run one's own node lets us customize Tipsy as a creator-first crowdfunding platform.
